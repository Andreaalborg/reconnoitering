# üöÄ GoHighLevel Email Integration Guide

**Last Updated:** 2025-06-19

## üìã What I Need From You

### 1. GoHighLevel API Credentials
I need the following information from your GoHighLevel account:

#### Location API Key (Required)
1. Log into your GoHighLevel account
2. Navigate to: **Location Level > Settings > Business Info**
3. Look for "API Keys" section
4. Generate or copy your Location API key

#### OAuth Credentials (If using OAuth)
1. Go to **Agency Settings > API Keys**
2. Create a new OAuth app if needed
3. Note down:
   - Client ID
   - Client Secret
   - Location ID

### 2. Email Settings
Please provide:
- **From Email**: The email address to send from (e.g., noreply@yourdomain.com)
- **From Name**: The sender name (e.g., "Reconnoitering")
- **Reply-To Email**: Where replies should go (optional)

### 3. Domain Verification (Important!)
Have you verified your sending domain in GoHighLevel?
- If not, you'll need to add DNS records they provide
- This ensures high deliverability

## üîß Integration Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Email Sending
I'll update the email service to:
1. Send verification emails when users register
2. Send password reset emails (future feature)
3. Send exhibition reminders (future feature)

### Phase 2: What I'll Implement

#### 1. Update Email Service
```javascript
// src/services/emailService.ts
// I'll replace console.log with actual GoHighLevel API calls
```

#### 2. Email Templates I'll Create
- **Verification Email**: Welcome message with verification link
- **Password Reset**: Secure reset link (future)
- **Exhibition Reminder**: Notification about upcoming visits (future)

#### 3. Features I'll Add
- Retry logic for failed sends
- Email tracking (opens, clicks)
- Unsubscribe handling
- Rate limiting to respect GHL limits

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Optional)
If you want, we can also implement:
- Marketing campaigns for new exhibitions
- Weekly digest emails
- Abandoned cart reminders (if users don't complete registration)
- Lead tracking integration

## üìä GoHighLevel API Limits

Based on your plan:
- **Rate Limit**: 100 requests per 10 seconds
- **Daily Limit**: 200,000 requests per day
- This is more than enough for our needs!

## üîê Security Considerations

1. **API Key Storage**: I'll store your API key in environment variables
2. **Encryption**: All API calls will use HTTPS
3. **Validation**: Email addresses will be validated before sending
4. **Logging**: Failed sends will be logged to Sentry

## üìù Environment Variables Needed

Add these to your `.env.local` file:
```env
# GoHighLevel Configuration
GHL_API_KEY=your-location-api-key-here
GHL_LOCATION_ID=your-location-id-here
GHL_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
GHL_FROM_NAME=Reconnoitering
GHL_REPLY_TO=support@yourdomain.com

# Optional: OAuth (if not using API key)
GHL_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
GHL_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

## üö¶ Testing Plan

1. **Development Testing**
   - Send test email to your address
   - Verify email arrives with correct formatting
   - Test verification link works

2. **Production Testing**
   - Register new user
   - Confirm email delivery
   - Monitor delivery rates

## ‚ùì Questions for You

1. **Email Design**: Do you want custom HTML templates or simple text emails?
2. **Branding**: Any specific colors, logos, or styling for emails?
3. **Language**: English only or multilingual support?
4. **Tracking**: Do you want to track email opens/clicks?
5. **Workflows**: Should we trigger any GoHighLevel workflows/automations?

## üìÖ Timeline

Once you provide the credentials:
- **Day 1**: Basic integration and testing
- **Day 2**: Template design and error handling
- **Day 3**: Production testing and optimization

## üÜò Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
1. **Emails not sending**: Check API key and domain verification
2. **Low deliverability**: Ensure SPF/DKIM records are set
3. **Rate limits**: We'll implement queuing if needed

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Gather the required credentials** from GoHighLevel
2. **Verify your sending domain** if not already done
3. **Decide on email templates** (I can create basic ones to start)
4. **Provide the environment variables** 

Once you have this information, I can complete the integration in a few hours!
