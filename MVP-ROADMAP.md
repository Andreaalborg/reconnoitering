# üöÄ MVP Roadmap - Reconnoitering

**Last Updated:** 2025-06-19

## üéØ Current Status
The application is functional but needs critical fixes before production deployment.

## üî¥ MVP Critical (Must Have Before Launch)

### 1. Email Service Integration
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Options:**
- **GoHighLevel** (You already have this!)
  - API v2 available at https://highlevel.stoplight.io/docs/integrations/
  - Supports email campaigns and transactional emails
  - Requires API key from Location Settings > Business Info
- **Alternative: SendGrid/Resend** if GHL doesn't work

**Action Required:**
```javascript
// Update /src/services/emailService.ts
// Replace console.log with actual email sending
// GoHighLevel API endpoint: POST /contacts/{contactId}/send-email
```

### 2. Mobile & Tablet Responsive Design
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Current Issues:**
- Navigation menu not optimized for mobile
- Exhibition cards don't stack properly
- Map view unusable on small screens
- Forms need mobile optimization

**Pages to Fix:**
- Home page
- Exhibitions list
- Map view
- Calendar
- User profile/favorites

### 3. Remove Development Endpoints
**Priority:** CRITICAL (Security Risk)
**Files to Delete:**
```bash
rm -rf src/app/dev/
rm -rf src/app/quick-verify/
rm -rf src/app/api/dev/
rm src/app/api/auth/temp-disable-verification/route.ts
rm src/app/api/test-sentry/route.ts
```

### 4. Analytics Functionality
**Priority:** HIGH
**Status:** Backend works, frontend exists at `/admin/analytics`
**Issues to Check:**
- Is data being tracked properly?
- Are the charts displaying correctly?
- Mobile view of analytics dashboard

## üü° Post-MVP High Priority

### 1. Security Enhancements
- CSRF protection
- Security headers (helmet.js)
- Proper CORS configuration
- Session timeout implementation

### 2. Performance Optimization
- Image lazy loading
- Next.js Image optimization
- Bundle size reduction
- Implement caching strategies

### 3. Design Consistency
- Update all pages to match new design
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Dark mode support (if desired)

## üü¢ Nice to Have (Future Features)

### 1. Advanced Features
- 2FA authentication
- Password reset flow
- Social login (Google/Facebook)
- Exhibition reminders/notifications
- User reviews and ratings

### 2. User Experience
- Advanced search filters
- Personalized recommendations
- Save search preferences
- Exhibition comparison tool
- Virtual gallery tours

### 3. Admin Features
- Content moderation tools
- Bulk exhibition import
- Analytics export
- User management dashboard
- Email campaign management

## üìã Quick Action Plan

### Week 1 (MVP Critical)
1. **Day 1-2:** Set up GoHighLevel email integration
   - Get API key
   - Update emailService.ts
   - Test registration emails
   
2. **Day 3-4:** Fix mobile responsive design
   - Start with navigation menu
   - Fix exhibition cards
   - Optimize forms
   
3. **Day 5:** Security cleanup
   - Remove all dev endpoints
   - Final security audit
   - Test production build

### Week 2 (Polish & Launch)
1. **Day 1-2:** Test analytics thoroughly
2. **Day 3-4:** Performance optimization
3. **Day 5:** Final testing and deployment

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Debt to Address

### High Priority
- Standardize error handling
- Add comprehensive logging
- Implement proper TypeScript types
- Add unit tests for critical paths

### Medium Priority
- Optimize database queries
- Implement proper caching
- Add API documentation
- Set up monitoring alerts

## üìä Success Metrics

### MVP Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can register and receive verification emails
- [ ] Mobile users can browse exhibitions comfortably
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities in production
- [ ] Analytics tracking visitor behavior
- [ ] Page load time under 3 seconds

### Post-Launch Metrics
- User registration rate
- Mobile vs desktop usage
- Most viewed exhibitions
- User engagement (favorites, time on site)
- Error rate < 0.1%

## üö® Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues
1. **GoHighLevel Integration Fails**
   - Backup: Use SendGrid (free tier available)
   - Timeline impact: +2 days

2. **Mobile Design Takes Longer**
   - Focus on critical pages first
   - Consider mobile-first CSS framework

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Use Vercel Analytics to identify bottlenecks
   - Implement gradual improvements

## üí° Quick Wins

1. **Add "Coming Soon" badges** for incomplete features
2. **Implement basic PWA** for mobile app feel
3. **Add social sharing buttons** for exhibitions
4. **Create sitemap.xml** for SEO
5. **Add Google Analytics** for additional insights

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Action:** Check if `/admin/analytics` is working
2. **Today:** Start GoHighLevel API integration
3. **This Week:** Complete MVP critical items
4. **Next Week:** Polish and prepare for launch

Remember: Perfect is the enemy of good. Launch with MVP, iterate based on user feedback.
