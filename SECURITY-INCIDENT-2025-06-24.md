# üö® SECURITY INCIDENT - Exposed Credentials

**Date:** 2025-06-24  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Status:** REMEDIATED IN DOCUMENTATION - CREDENTIALS MUST BE ROTATED

## Summary

GitHub detected possible secrets in commit. Investigation revealed:
1. MongoDB password exposed in documentation files
2. Google Maps API key example that looked real

## Exposed Credentials

### 1. MongoDB Password
**File:** ENVIRONMENT-VARIABLES-LIST.md  
**Exposed:** Full connection string with username and password  
**Status:** REMOVED - Replaced with placeholders  
**Action Required:** üî¥ ROTATE PASSWORD IMMEDIATELY

### 2. Google Maps API Key  
**File:** ENVIRONMENT-VARIABLES-PRODUCTION.md  
**Exposed:** Example API key that looked real  
**Status:** REMOVED - Replaced with placeholder  
**Action Required:** üü° Verify if this was a real key

## Immediate Actions Taken

1. **Documentation Updated:**
   - Replaced all real credentials with placeholders
   - Changed MongoDB URI to: `mongodb+srv://[USERNAME]:[PASSWORD]@[CLUSTER].mongodb.net/`
   - Changed API key example to: `AIzaSy[YOUR-API-KEY-HERE]`

2. **Files Modified:**
   - ENVIRONMENT-VARIABLES-LIST.md
   - ENVIRONMENT-VARIABLES-PRODUCTION.md

## Required Actions

### 1. CRITICAL - Rotate MongoDB Password
```bash
# In MongoDB Atlas:
1. Go to Database Access
2. Edit user 'intsenai'
3. Generate new password
4. Update password in all environments
5. Update Netlify environment variables
```

### 2. Check Google Maps API Key
```bash
# In Google Cloud Console:
1. Check if the exposed key was real
2. If real, delete it immediately
3. Create new API key
4. Add domain restrictions
```

### 3. Audit Git History
```bash
# Check if credentials exist in other commits
git log -p -S "20fNK8j2r8MQhHD3"
git log -p -S "AIzaSyD"
```

### 4. Consider Git History Cleaning
If credentials were committed earlier:
- Use BFG Repo-Cleaner or git filter-branch
- Force push to remove from history
- Notify all developers to re-clone

## Prevention Measures

1. **Never put real credentials in documentation**
   - Always use placeholders like [PASSWORD]
   - Use example.com for domains
   - Use xxx for sensitive parts

2. **Use git-secrets or similar tools**
   ```bash
   # Install git-secrets
   brew install git-secrets
   git secrets --install
   git secrets --register-aws
   ```

3. **Add pre-commit hooks**
   - Scan for credentials before commit
   - Block commits with secrets

4. **Regular audits**
   - Review all .md files for secrets
   - Check environment variable docs

## Lessons Learned

1. Documentation should NEVER contain real credentials
2. Even "example" credentials should be obviously fake
3. GitHub's secret scanning is valuable - pay attention!
4. Rotate credentials immediately when exposed

## Status

- ‚úÖ Documentation cleaned
- ‚ùå MongoDB password NOT rotated yet
- ‚ùì Google API key status unknown
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Git history may still contain secrets

**THIS IS A CRITICAL SECURITY INCIDENT. ROTATE CREDENTIALS IMMEDIATELY!**
